This can automatically generate the OpenAPI specification for the Hono API using your validation schema, which can be used to generate client libraries, documentation, and more.

Supported Validation Libraries:

- [x] [Zod](https://zod.dev/)
- [ ] [TypeBox](https://github.com/sinclairzx81/typebox)
- [ ] [Valibot](https://valibot.dev/)
- [ ] [ArkType](https://arktype.io/)

## Usage

### Installation

You can install the package using favorite package manager.

```bash
pnpm add hono-openapi
```

### Basic Usage

#### Setting up your application

First, define your schemas, here is an example using Zod:

```ts
import z from "zod";

// For extending the Zod schema with OpenAPI properties
import "zod-openapi/extend";

const querySchema = z
  .object({
    name: z.string().optional().openapi({ example: "Steven" }),
  })
  .openapi({ ref: "Query" });

const responseSchema = z.string().openapi({ example: "Hello Steven!" });
```

Extending the Zod schema with OpenAPI properties is optional, but it will help you generate the OpenAPI specification. You can learn more about it here - [https://github.com/samchungy/zod-openapi](https://github.com/samchungy/zod-openapi).

> [!Tip]
> The `querySchema` schema will be registered as "#/components/schemas/Query" refs in the OpenAPI document. If you want to register the schema as referenced components, use .openapi() method.

Next, create your route -

```ts
import { Hono } from "hono";
import { describeRoute } from "hono-openapi";
import { resolver, validator as zValidator } from "hono-openapi/zod";

const app = new Hono();

app.get(
  "/",
  describeRoute({
    description: "Say hello to the user",
    responses: {
      200: {
        description: "Successful greeting response",
        content: {
          "text/plain": {
            schema: resolver(responseSchema),
          },
        },
      },
    },
  }),
  zValidator("query", querySchema),
  (c) => {
    const query = c.req.valid("query");
    return c.text(`Hello ${query?.name ?? "Hono"}!`);
  }
);
```

You might be wondering why are we importing `validator` from `hono-openapi/zod` instead of `@hono/zod-validator` and as `zValidator`? This is because `hono-openapi` provides a wrapper around the `@hono/zod-validator` to make it easier to use. The idea is if you are already using `@hono/zod-validator` to validate your schemas, you can easily switch to `hono-openapi` without changing much of your code.

Finally, generate the OpenAPI specification -

```ts
app.get(
  "/openapi",
  openAPISpecs(app, {
    documentation: {
      info: {
        title: "Hono",
        version: "1.0.0",
        description: "API for greeting users",
      },
      servers: [
        {
          url: "http://localhost:3000",
          description: "Local server",
        },
      ],
    },
  })
);
```

Now, you can access the OpenAPI specification by visiting `http://localhost:3000/openapi`, and you can use this specification to generate client libraries, documentation, and more. Some tools that I used to generate documentation are -

- [Swagger UI](https://github.com/honojs/middleware/tree/main/packages/swagger-ui)
- [Scalar](https://github.com/scalar/scalar/tree/main/packages/hono-api-reference)

##### Scalar Example

```ts
app.get(
  "/docs",
  apiReference({
    theme: "saturn",
    spec: {
      url: "/openapi",
    },
  })
);
```

And that's it! You have successfully generated the OpenAPI specification for your Hono API.

### Advanced Usage

#### Adding Security Definitions

You can add security definitions to your OpenAPI specification by using the `security` property in the `openAPISpecs` function.

```ts
app.get(
  "/openapi",
  openAPISpecs(appRouter, {
    documentation: {
      info: {
        title: "Rhinobase Cloud",
        version: "1.0.0",
        description: "API Documentation",
      },
      components: {
        securitySchemes: {
          bearerAuth: {
            type: "http",
            scheme: "bearer",
            bearerFormat: "JWT",
          },
        },
      },
      security: [
        {
          bearerAuth: [],
        },
      ],
      servers: [
        {
          url: "http://localhost:3004",
          description: "Local server",
        },
      ],
    },
  })
);
```

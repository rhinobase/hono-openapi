This can automatically generate the OpenAPI specification for the Hono API using your validation schema, which can be used to generate client libraries, documentation, and more.

This lib supports all the validation libs which are [Standard Schema](https://standardschema.dev/) compliant.

- This project would not have been possible without the work of [Sam Chung](https://github.com/samchungy) and his [Zod OpenAPI](https://github.com/samchungy/zod-openapi) package.
